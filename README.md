# hacky-winterland-2 (submission for a hackathon)

### Inspiration
Holidays can be lonely for some, and my hope is that this game brings some inner peace to those people. This top down, pixelated art game was also inspired by Pokemon in order to invoke a sense of nostalgia to comfort those playing it.

### What it does
The music is serene and the imagery nostalgic. Furthermore, similar to Pokemon where there is often a battle encounter when walking through environments such as grass, this game has randomized "encounters" when straying from the path and walking in snow. These encounters are in the form of encouraging text dialogue, as this game is meant to be therapeutic to those going through stressful and lonely times.

### How I built it
For both backend and frontend, the main components were JavaScript and HTML. For frontend, a software caled "Tiled" was used to create the map. Through the use of this software and extractions of .json files from it, collision detecting software was encoded so that the player is in a realistic environment.

### Challenges I ran into & accomplishments that I'm proud of
I had very little knowledge of JavaScript going into this, and no experience with game design whatsoever. I learned how to animate sprites, do worldbuilding, and most importantly have fun!

### What I learned
Game design is fun! I used to love messing around on Scratch when I was little, so when I looked up tutorials and saw the term "sprite", it was like a blast from the past. Speaking of blast from the past, now I know how to code a game that is similar to Pokemon as well, which is amazing!

### What's next for HomeAlone
I wanted to incorporate minigames and prizes within the random encounters, but of course ran into time constraints. The minigames would have been relaxing ones, such as a Flappy Bird replica. And the prizes would be winter themed, like a cup of hot chocolate!
